1
00:00:03,958 --> 00:00:06,772
Did you know
that up to 300 serial killers

2
00:00:06,892 --> 00:00:08,662
are active on any given day?

3
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,665
I like to think
of them as my friends.

4
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:14,034
Serial killer Joe Carroll's life

5
00:00:14,102 --> 00:00:17,571
came to an end
early this morning.

6
00:00:17,639 --> 00:00:19,473
Is it true?

7
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,074
Resurrection!

8
00:00:21,142 --> 00:00:22,376
Joe Carroll lives.

9
00:00:22,443 --> 00:00:23,744
Aah!

10
00:00:24,337 --> 00:00:25,271
This new cult...

11
00:00:25,338 --> 00:00:26,272
Drive, dear.

12
00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:27,439
Yes, mother.

13
00:00:27,507 --> 00:00:28,507
They will kill you.

14
00:00:28,575 --> 00:00:29,942
Probably.

15
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,044
You have
a family--me.

16
00:00:32,112 --> 00:00:35,147
If something happened
to you, that would end me.

17
00:00:35,215 --> 00:00:37,216
Joe faked his death,
started again.

18
00:00:37,284 --> 00:00:39,151
How does Lily Gray
fit into all this?

19
00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:40,719
She's the female version of Joe.

20
00:00:40,787 --> 00:00:42,221
You take from me,
I take from you.

21
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:43,622
That's my dad's house.

22
00:00:44,758 --> 00:00:46,458
Mike!
Don't do this.

23
00:00:48,995 --> 00:00:50,496
They're all gonna pay.

24
00:00:51,598 --> 00:00:54,233
You've become the man you hate.

25
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:55,601
Do it!

26
00:00:55,669 --> 00:00:57,903
Arrest him.

27
00:00:57,971 --> 00:01:00,306
After all this is over,

28
00:01:00,373 --> 00:01:02,708
you and me, we're
gonna go have a life.

29
00:01:04,211 --> 00:01:05,578
Kiss her!

30
00:01:08,682 --> 00:01:09,982
Yeah!

31
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,838
Gina looks so beautiful.

32
00:01:32,906 --> 00:01:35,441
I mean, I usually hate
weddings, but this one is--

33
00:01:35,509 --> 00:01:36,542
No. It's special.

34
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,912
Yeah. Uh-oh.
Two o'clock.

35
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,113
There's a hottie by the bar,

36
00:01:41,181 --> 00:01:42,448
and she's checking you out.

37
00:01:42,516 --> 00:01:43,582
No. Come on.

38
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,617
Yes.

39
00:01:44,684 --> 00:01:46,685
- Really?
- Definitely.

40
00:01:46,753 --> 00:01:47,820
Here goes nothing.

41
00:01:47,888 --> 00:01:49,388
Mm-hmm.

42
00:01:54,861 --> 00:01:57,830
So friend of the bride
or friend of the other bride?

43
00:01:59,232 --> 00:02:01,300
How long did you
work on that line?

44
00:02:01,368 --> 00:02:02,835
Not good enough?

45
00:02:02,903 --> 00:02:04,003
It was a little
underwhelming, to be honest.

46
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,005
Wow! This is not
at all

47
00:02:06,072 --> 00:02:08,007
how I expected this this to go.

48
00:02:08,074 --> 00:02:10,376
You want to try again?

49
00:02:10,443 --> 00:02:12,378
How about this?

50
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:22,354
Better?

51
00:02:22,422 --> 00:02:25,524
Yeah. That works.

52
00:02:25,592 --> 00:02:28,160
Wow! You're beautiful.

53
00:02:30,197 --> 00:02:31,464
- Mmm. Ryan.
- What?

54
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:32,731
I love this song.

55
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:34,633
No. Uh-huh. No.
I don't dance.

56
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:36,135
- Yes, you do.
- Gwen, I don't.

57
00:02:36,203 --> 00:02:37,403
You've been holding out on me.

58
00:02:37,404 --> 00:02:38,904

- Hey.
- Hey.

78
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,921
I didn't know if
you were gonna make it.

79
00:03:34,928 --> 00:03:37,596
I almost didn't I came
right from the airport.

80
00:03:37,664 --> 00:03:40,299
Ah. This is Gwen.
Mike, Gwen.

81
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:42,668
He talks about you all the time.

82
00:03:42,736 --> 00:03:45,371
Ok. Hi.
You're responsible

83
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:46,539
for the big grin
on this guy's face.

84
00:03:46,606 --> 00:03:48,440
Mike.

85
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:52,478
You look great.

86
00:03:52,546 --> 00:03:56,615
Thanks. Uh, this is--
this is Tom Reyes.

87
00:03:56,683 --> 00:03:57,750
Mike Weston.

88
00:03:57,818 --> 00:03:59,485
You're just back from the field?

89
00:03:59,553 --> 00:04:00,920
Yeah.

90
00:04:00,987 --> 00:04:03,722
Uh, Tom works for our
hostage rescue team

91
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,124
in New York.

92
00:04:05,192 --> 00:04:08,194
"Our." So it's true.
You joined the bureau.

93
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:11,063
I've got about
a month on the job.

94
00:04:11,131 --> 00:04:13,299
Heh.

95
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:15,034
You look thirsty.
Do you want a drink?

96
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:17,236
- Yeah, yeah. Let's go.
- Come on.

97
00:04:17,304 --> 00:04:18,838
Lead the way.

98
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,141
♪ Up and down the highway ♪

99
00:04:22,209 --> 00:04:23,776
- Hey.
- Ooh. Careful.

100
00:04:23,844 --> 00:04:25,911
Oh, yeah. That was
definitely my fault.

101
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:27,146
Look at her.
She's been through hell.

102
00:04:27,214 --> 00:04:28,848
She deserves a little joy, huh?

103
00:04:28,915 --> 00:04:30,649
Yeah. I think we all
deserve some peace.

104
00:04:30,717 --> 00:04:32,685
Amen to that. I know I'll
feel a whole lot better

105
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:35,020
when they finally put Joe
Carroll out of his misery.

106
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:36,722
Less than a month, man.

107
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,591
Well, here's to all the
questions and second guessing

108
00:04:38,658 --> 00:04:42,528
dying along with him.
Salud.

109
00:04:42,596 --> 00:04:44,797
It would appear that
the FBI allowed Mr. Hardy

110
00:04:44,865 --> 00:04:47,433
to conduct his own
lawless reign of terror

111
00:04:47,501 --> 00:04:49,101
to find Joe Carroll.

112
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:50,736
That couldn't be further
from the truth, congressman.

113
00:04:50,804 --> 00:04:53,105
You have anything you'd
like add, Agent Hardy?

114
00:05:00,046 --> 00:05:02,381
Nope.

115
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:04,550
Well, while we're appreciative

116
00:05:04,618 --> 00:05:05,818
of the work you've done

117
00:05:05,886 --> 00:05:07,052
in apprehending Joe Carroll,

118
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,522
I don't think we can
in good conscience

119
00:05:09,589 --> 00:05:11,790
simply ignore your methods

120
00:05:11,858 --> 00:05:14,226
and the many lives lost.

121
00:05:14,294 --> 00:05:16,462
That said, at this time,

122
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:19,365
our investigation has found
no substantive evidence

123
00:05:19,432 --> 00:05:20,699
of criminal wrongdoing.

124
00:05:36,483 --> 00:05:37,783
Hello.

125
00:05:37,851 --> 00:05:39,385
Sorry I can't stay late.

126
00:05:39,452 --> 00:05:41,320
I have the early shift
in the ER tomorrow.

127
00:05:41,388 --> 00:05:42,321
Stay at my place.

128
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:43,470
It's close to the hospital.

129
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,423
Again?

130
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:45,758
Yeah. Why not?

131
00:05:45,826 --> 00:05:47,059
So you're saying you
like having me around?

132
00:05:47,127 --> 00:05:49,228
Uh, yeah. I think
you know that.

133
00:05:49,296 --> 00:05:52,064
Because my lease is up
at the end of the month.

134
00:05:52,132 --> 00:05:54,333
Oh! I see what
you did there.

135
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:55,668
You said we'd talk about it.

136
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:57,937
And we will,
but right now, cake!

137
00:05:58,004 --> 00:05:59,338
Must have cake.

138
00:05:59,406 --> 00:06:01,307
Ryan, you coward.

139
00:06:07,681 --> 00:06:10,449
Oh. I'm so sorry.

140
00:06:10,517 --> 00:06:12,651
I didn't mean to frighten you.

141
00:06:12,719 --> 00:06:14,720
Yeah. It's ok.

142
00:06:14,788 --> 00:06:17,022
Was that Ryan Hardy
you were talking to?

143
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:20,259
Yeah. Do you know him?

144
00:06:20,327 --> 00:06:22,928
Just from the news.

145
00:06:22,996 --> 00:06:25,164
I should really get back inside.

146
00:06:25,232 --> 00:06:26,465
He's the guy who caught

147
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:28,601
Joe Carroll, right?

148
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,772
Yeah, that's right.

149
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,642
People are calling him a hero.

150
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:39,478
The toasts are starting.
Excuse me.

151
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:40,813
Make a toast.
Go ahead, Ryan.

152
00:06:40,881 --> 00:06:43,149
Whenever you're ready.
Just fire away.

153
00:06:45,552 --> 00:06:47,386
When you meet the right girl,

154
00:06:47,454 --> 00:06:50,055
you just know.

155
00:06:50,123 --> 00:06:52,992
And may--maybe
you're not even looking,

156
00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:55,761
and then suddenly, there she is,

157
00:06:55,829 --> 00:06:57,696
and she's such a perfect fit,

158
00:06:57,764 --> 00:06:59,398
you can't deny it,

159
00:06:59,466 --> 00:07:01,667
and you got to--
you got to give her

160
00:07:01,735 --> 00:07:03,803
a place in your heart,

161
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,639
a place that you
didn't even think

162
00:07:06,706 --> 00:07:08,507
existed anymore,

163
00:07:08,575 --> 00:07:10,843
and then everything changes,

164
00:07:10,911 --> 00:07:14,713
and where there was hurt,

165
00:07:14,781 --> 00:07:17,583
there's comfort.

166
00:07:17,651 --> 00:07:19,351
Where there was dark,

167
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:21,320
there's light.

168
00:07:21,388 --> 00:07:23,489
If you find that kind of love,

169
00:07:23,557 --> 00:07:25,324
you got to hang on, man.

170
00:07:25,392 --> 00:07:26,459
Amen to that.

171
00:07:26,526 --> 00:07:27,893
You don't let go.

172
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:29,495
You don't let go.

173
00:07:29,563 --> 00:07:31,831
Cheers.

174
00:07:31,898 --> 00:07:33,365
Liar!

175
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,205
You killed my daughter!

176
00:07:39,272 --> 00:07:40,606
She was at the Korban compound!

177
00:07:40,674 --> 00:07:44,176
You shot her in cold blood!

178
00:07:44,244 --> 00:07:46,045
She did not deserve that!

179
00:07:46,113 --> 00:07:47,213
She was 19.

180
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,481
Sir.

181
00:07:48,548 --> 00:07:53,385
Sherry--Sherry was
such a beautiful girl.

182
00:07:53,453 --> 00:07:55,721
She just lost her way.

183
00:08:01,228 --> 00:08:04,130
You're a murderer.

184
00:08:04,197 --> 00:08:06,699
You and Joe Carroll
should be sharing a cell

185
00:08:06,767 --> 00:08:09,001
on death row.

186
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:11,070
Guys.

187
00:08:11,138 --> 00:08:13,072
Let him go.

188
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,273
Are you sure?

189
00:08:14,341 --> 00:08:15,975
It's all right.
Let him go.

190
00:08:26,944 --> 00:08:36,414
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

191
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,118
Morning.

192
00:08:55,185 --> 00:08:57,420
Hey.

193
00:08:57,488 --> 00:08:58,588
Sleep ok?

194
00:08:58,655 --> 00:08:59,856
Yeah. You?

195
00:08:59,923 --> 00:09:01,924
Your FBI buddies sure know how

196
00:09:01,992 --> 00:09:03,693
to throw a wedding.

197
00:09:03,761 --> 00:09:05,728
I got to say I didn't
see that coming.

198
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:07,096
Yeah.

199
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,309
Ryan, that man's grief
was heartbreaking,

200
00:09:19,376 --> 00:09:22,278
but you can't blame yourself
for his daughter's death.

201
00:09:22,346 --> 00:09:24,047
You were doing your job.

202
00:09:24,114 --> 00:09:27,050
I know.

203
00:09:27,117 --> 00:09:28,751
How many more people would
Joe Carroll have killed

204
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:30,253
if you hadn't stopped him?

205
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:33,323
But so many lost
their lives, you know,

206
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:36,392
and it's easy to see them as
just an extension of Joe,

207
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,762
but I don't even
recognize that name--Sherry.

208
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:42,031
The more I really
think about it,

209
00:09:42,099 --> 00:09:44,434
there's only a handful
of names that I do remember.

210
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,970
Joe Carroll turned those
people into killers.

211
00:09:47,037 --> 00:09:52,008
But their lives, their
families should still matter.

212
00:09:52,076 --> 00:09:54,210
And they do.

213
00:09:54,278 --> 00:09:56,512
Then why don't I
remember their names?

214
00:10:01,719 --> 00:10:04,487
Hopkins, track down a
file for me, will you?

215
00:10:04,555 --> 00:10:08,024
Deceased Korban member named
Sherry, last name unknown.

216
00:10:08,092 --> 00:10:09,492
I'll see what I can find.

217
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,994
All right. Thanks.

218
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:14,964
Mendez.

219
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:16,399
Hey.

220
00:10:16,467 --> 00:10:18,268
How's Dawn holding up?

221
00:10:18,335 --> 00:10:19,869
Wasn't how we dreamed our
wedding reception would end,

222
00:10:19,937 --> 00:10:21,704
but she's hanging in there.

223
00:10:21,772 --> 00:10:23,606
Oh. Make it up to her
on your honeymoon?

224
00:10:23,674 --> 00:10:26,609
Which I had to postpone till
after Joe Carroll's execution.

225
00:10:26,677 --> 00:10:29,279
So she's just loving being
married to the FBI.

226
00:10:29,346 --> 00:10:31,080
Pretty much.

227
00:10:31,148 --> 00:10:32,348
For the past 9 months,
I've been following up

228
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:33,696
on rumors of Mark Gray sightings

229
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:35,051
in Europe and South America.

230
00:10:35,119 --> 00:10:36,986
I do believe I've
isolated and frozen most

231
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:38,788
of the considerable
Gray fortune.

232
00:10:38,856 --> 00:10:40,523
I feel confident that
following through

233
00:10:40,591 --> 00:10:42,559
with this protocol will eventually
force Gray into the open.

234
00:10:42,626 --> 00:10:44,727
Thank you, Agent Weston.

235
00:10:44,795 --> 00:10:47,463
Carroll's execution's set
for the end of this month.

236
00:10:47,531 --> 00:10:49,132
We all need to be on the lookout

237
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,667
for any suspicious activity.

238
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:53,469
We believe we've eliminated
his network of followers,

239
00:10:53,537 --> 00:10:55,705
but as you all know, we could
never be absolutely sure.

240
00:10:55,773 --> 00:10:57,273
Carroll himself is not a threat.

241
00:10:57,341 --> 00:10:58,775
Since his recapture, he's been

242
00:10:58,842 --> 00:11:00,410
under 24-hour
lockdown

243
00:11:00,477 --> 00:11:01,878
in an undisclosed
federal facility.

244
00:11:01,946 --> 00:11:03,913
I've been monitoring the web.

245
00:11:03,981 --> 00:11:05,849
There's a lot of chatter but no
confirmed threats to public safety.

246
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,350
Stay on that.

247
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:09,085
I need you all to be vigilant.

248
00:11:09,153 --> 00:11:12,822
A new threat could expose
itself at any moment.

249
00:11:24,268 --> 00:11:25,768
Her.

250
00:11:33,477 --> 00:11:34,410
Hi.

251
00:11:34,478 --> 00:11:35,345
Hey.

252
00:11:35,412 --> 00:11:37,180
I'm Natalie,

253
00:11:37,248 --> 00:11:39,382
and, uh, that's
my husband Kenny.

254
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,384
It's our second
wedding anniversary.

255
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:42,652
Congratulations.

256
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,521
The first year's the hardest.

257
00:11:44,588 --> 00:11:46,022
Tell me about it.

258
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:50,527
Anyway, my husband
thinks you're stunning.

259
00:11:50,594 --> 00:11:52,428
That's sweet.

260
00:11:52,496 --> 00:11:54,964
So would it be wrong if I asked

261
00:11:55,032 --> 00:11:56,966
if you were working?

262
00:11:57,034 --> 00:11:59,035
I'd be happy to make
your anniversary

263
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,804
something to remember

264
00:12:00,871 --> 00:12:03,106
just so long as you know couples
cost a little bit more.

265
00:12:10,548 --> 00:12:12,615
Hold on, hold on.

266
00:12:12,683 --> 00:12:14,117
Hold on, Kenny.

267
00:12:14,185 --> 00:12:16,686
This has to be fun
for both of you.

268
00:12:23,327 --> 00:12:24,294
No, no, no.

269
00:12:24,361 --> 00:12:26,229
Stay where you are.

270
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:29,532
Enjoy the anticipation.

271
00:12:41,712 --> 00:12:44,681
Make it nice and tight.

272
00:13:03,601 --> 00:13:05,869
What the hell was that?

273
00:13:08,973 --> 00:13:11,674
Kenny, I-I think
it's coming from the closet.

274
00:13:30,861 --> 00:13:32,562
No, no, no!

275
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,930
Unh!

276
00:13:50,815 --> 00:13:52,782
You started without me, Daisy?

277
00:13:58,155 --> 00:13:59,355
Don't pout, Kyle.

278
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,324
I was just getting
my engine started.

279
00:14:01,392 --> 00:14:03,626
You know the best
is yet to come.

280
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:09,999
They were on their
second wedding anniversary.

281
00:14:10,067 --> 00:14:12,368
Oh, sweet.

282
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:13,870
What do I call you?

283
00:14:13,938 --> 00:14:15,638
Natalie.

284
00:14:15,706 --> 00:14:17,173
And what's my name?

285
00:14:17,241 --> 00:14:18,608
Kenny,

286
00:14:18,676 --> 00:14:20,944
and you're kind of aggro.

287
00:14:25,082 --> 00:14:26,616
It's good to have
you back, Mike.

288
00:14:26,684 --> 00:14:27,884
Doesn't seem like I've
been missed around here.

289
00:14:27,952 --> 00:14:30,019
Well, you have.
I've missed you.

290
00:14:30,087 --> 00:14:31,221
Thanks.

291
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:33,423
Hey. Gwen--
she seems great.

292
00:14:33,491 --> 00:14:35,125
How long have you two
been together?

293
00:14:35,192 --> 00:14:36,960
About 6 months. Honestly,
I haven't felt like this

294
00:14:37,028 --> 00:14:38,828
in a really long time.

295
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:42,032
And Joe?

296
00:14:44,001 --> 00:14:45,135
You been to see him?

297
00:14:45,202 --> 00:14:47,470
Nope. I've moved on.

298
00:14:48,973 --> 00:14:50,473
You will, too,

299
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:53,710
as soon as we catch Mark.

300
00:14:53,778 --> 00:14:55,745
Who knows? Maybe
you'll take my job.

301
00:14:55,813 --> 00:14:57,313
What, are you leaving us?

302
00:14:57,381 --> 00:14:59,015
When it's time.

303
00:15:09,894 --> 00:15:11,428
Don't go.

304
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:12,529
I have to go.

305
00:15:12,596 --> 00:15:13,863
No, you don't.

306
00:15:13,931 --> 00:15:15,732
We've talked about this.

307
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,333
Mark is still out there.

308
00:15:17,401 --> 00:15:19,736
And every law enforcement
agency in the world

309
00:15:19,804 --> 00:15:21,204
is hunting him.

310
00:15:21,272 --> 00:15:22,639
That doesn't matter.

311
00:15:22,707 --> 00:15:24,808
Catching him is my job.

312
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,210
You mean killing him.

313
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:29,079
If that's what it takes.

314
00:15:30,748 --> 00:15:32,949
Like Lily.

315
00:15:33,017 --> 00:15:34,818
I know I put you
in a bad position.

316
00:15:34,885 --> 00:15:36,186
A bad position?

317
00:15:36,253 --> 00:15:38,588
Mike, I covered up an execution.

318
00:15:38,656 --> 00:15:40,256
They murdered my father
in front of me.

319
00:15:40,324 --> 00:15:41,458
I have no problem putting
her down the way I did.

320
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:42,659
If you do, I'm sorry.

321
00:15:42,727 --> 00:15:45,061
Mike, please.

322
00:15:47,098 --> 00:15:50,767
Stay here with me.

323
00:15:50,835 --> 00:15:52,669
I can't.

324
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,574
Look. I'll call you
when I land.

325
00:15:57,641 --> 00:15:59,075
Don't.

326
00:16:08,386 --> 00:16:09,652
We should catch up sometime.

327
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,023
Yeah. When things
calm down around here.

328
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,662
Agent Hardy.

329
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:19,796
Sherry, last name Miller.

330
00:16:19,864 --> 00:16:21,297
19 years old from Queens.

331
00:16:21,365 --> 00:16:22,699
She died of a through-and-through
gunshot wound

332
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:23,867
to the neck during
the raid on Korban.

333
00:16:23,934 --> 00:16:25,502
No way to know who shot her.

334
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:27,070
Thanks.

335
00:16:43,387 --> 00:16:46,656
What are you doing, Ryan?

336
00:16:46,724 --> 00:16:48,325
Guy from the wedding.

337
00:16:48,392 --> 00:16:49,993
It's his daughter.

338
00:16:50,061 --> 00:16:51,821
She was one of Joe Carroll's
followers, right?

339
00:16:51,829 --> 00:16:53,530
Yeah.

340
00:16:53,597 --> 00:16:57,901
We put all of that
stuff behind us.

341
00:16:57,968 --> 00:17:00,603
Just let it go.

342
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,172
Yeah.

343
00:17:19,123 --> 00:17:20,690
I'm Ryan Hardy.

344
00:17:20,758 --> 00:17:23,860
Yeah, I know who you are.

345
00:17:23,928 --> 00:17:26,029
Sorry to bother you.
I was hoping I could

346
00:17:26,097 --> 00:17:29,366
talk to you about your daughter.

347
00:17:29,433 --> 00:17:31,134
I just needed to say I'm sorry

348
00:17:31,202 --> 00:17:33,937
about what happened to Sherry.

349
00:17:34,005 --> 00:17:36,272
No parent should have to
bury a child.

350
00:17:39,477 --> 00:17:41,711
I loved my daughter,

351
00:17:41,779 --> 00:17:44,414
but she was a troubled girl.

352
00:17:44,482 --> 00:17:48,051
I don't blame you
for what happened.

353
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:51,154
Is your husband here? I was
hoping I could talk to him, too.

354
00:17:51,222 --> 00:17:52,622
Jimmy.

355
00:17:55,993 --> 00:17:58,028
Can I help you?

356
00:17:58,095 --> 00:17:59,930
You're Sherry's father?

357
00:17:59,997 --> 00:18:01,197
Yes.

358
00:18:06,804 --> 00:18:08,171
You were supposed to be
here 20 minutes ago.

359
00:18:08,239 --> 00:18:09,806
Knowing you two,

360
00:18:09,874 --> 00:18:12,075
I know what was going on
in here 20 minutes ago.

361
00:18:12,143 --> 00:18:15,512
I'd say right on time.

362
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,014
This is all wrong.

363
00:18:18,082 --> 00:18:21,351
We have to make this perfect,

364
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:23,253
or he'll kill us all.

365
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,018
Looks like
the crazy is starting.

366
00:18:44,189 --> 00:18:45,556
No!

367
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:46,957
Unh!

368
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:47,857
They were killed this afternoon.

369
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,447
Liar!

370
00:18:49,515 --> 00:18:50,348
Ryan.

371
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,616
They've told lies!

372
00:18:51,684 --> 00:18:54,319
Ryan?

373
00:18:54,387 --> 00:18:56,387
Why don't
I remember their names?

374
00:18:58,224 --> 00:18:59,224
Ryan.

375
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,397
Get an I.D.
on our victims?

376
00:19:05,464 --> 00:19:06,631
Kenny and Natalie Brooks,

377
00:19:06,699 --> 00:19:08,466
in town from Greenwich.

378
00:19:10,836 --> 00:19:13,405
Bartender says he saw them talking
to a prostitute at the bar,

379
00:19:13,472 --> 00:19:16,341
but all he remembers
is that she was a brunette.

380
00:19:16,409 --> 00:19:18,176
You think this was Joe's people?

381
00:19:18,244 --> 00:19:21,413
Uh, there's no mention
of Joe here, just me.

382
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,848
This is the second time
in 24 hours

383
00:19:22,915 --> 00:19:24,482
that I've been called a liar.

384
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,717
Yeah. We'll, that can't
be a coincidence.

385
00:19:25,785 --> 00:19:27,025
Our fake dad from the wedding's

386
00:19:27,086 --> 00:19:28,553
got to be tied to us somehow.

387
00:19:28,621 --> 00:19:29,955
Wedding photographer's
already pulling photographs.

388
00:19:30,022 --> 00:19:31,662
Hopefully we'll get
a match in the system.

389
00:19:31,724 --> 00:19:33,959
Hotel has the room listed
as empty,

390
00:19:34,026 --> 00:19:35,727
so we think that our hooker used

391
00:19:35,795 --> 00:19:37,562
a maid's card key to get in.

392
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:39,331
Oh. The maid's body
is in the closet.

393
00:19:39,398 --> 00:19:40,932
Hotel security video?

394
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,434
Disabled during the attack.

395
00:19:42,502 --> 00:19:44,603
Our girl knew what
she was doing.

396
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:46,371
She wasn't alone.

397
00:19:46,439 --> 00:19:48,373
Definitely more than
one attacker.

398
00:19:48,441 --> 00:19:50,108
Most likely a male
based on the strength

399
00:19:50,176 --> 00:19:52,744
required to stage this,

400
00:19:52,812 --> 00:19:55,447
and they're not done.

401
00:19:55,515 --> 00:19:56,848
How do you know?

402
00:19:56,916 --> 00:20:00,552
They got some kind
of an agenda or message,

403
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,454
and they know that they
haven't given us enough yet

404
00:20:02,522 --> 00:20:03,922
to figure it out.

405
00:20:06,592 --> 00:20:09,261
Which means the killing
is only beginning.

406
00:20:19,939 --> 00:20:23,508
You two have a room, you know?

407
00:20:23,576 --> 00:20:27,512
Our love cannot be
contained in a room.

408
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,713
Hey. Andrew,
sweetie,

409
00:20:28,781 --> 00:20:30,649
do you have any more
of those yogurts?

410
00:20:30,716 --> 00:20:32,184
You mean my yogurts.

411
00:20:32,251 --> 00:20:34,386
Listen. I've clearly marked
my food in the fridge,

412
00:20:34,453 --> 00:20:36,021
so if you two could
just respect the labels.

413
00:20:36,088 --> 00:20:37,255
Heh heh.
Are you kidding?

414
00:20:37,323 --> 00:20:38,523
Not even a little bit.

415
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:40,258
This little forced marriage
between us

416
00:20:40,326 --> 00:20:42,761
is going to work much better
if we have boundaries.

417
00:20:42,829 --> 00:20:46,097
Whatever, bro.

418
00:20:46,165 --> 00:20:47,566
Has he even come downstairs?

419
00:20:47,633 --> 00:20:49,000
Did he ask how it went?

420
00:20:49,068 --> 00:20:50,702
No. He's in one
of his moods.

421
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:53,972
Well, we have a job
to do, all right?

422
00:20:54,006 --> 00:20:55,774
Let's just get it done,

423
00:20:55,842 --> 00:20:57,943
and we can get our lives back.

424
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:01,112
Ok.

425
00:21:04,584 --> 00:21:06,918
We're still adjusting
to the time difference.

426
00:21:06,986 --> 00:21:09,054
There is no time difference
between here and Ohio.

427
00:21:09,121 --> 00:21:11,223
Just give me a minute.
I'll rally.

428
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,959
You know what?
Forget it.

429
00:21:14,026 --> 00:21:16,461
I'll do this one myself.

430
00:21:18,064 --> 00:21:19,798
We'll meet you later.

431
00:21:19,866 --> 00:21:20,947
Maybe I should go with him?

432
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,801
He's fine.

433
00:21:22,869 --> 00:21:25,737
That guy is one seriously
twisted individual.

434
00:21:32,145 --> 00:21:33,645
She was, uh...

435
00:21:33,713 --> 00:21:36,815
she was so beautiful.

436
00:21:36,883 --> 00:21:39,651
I can't believe that
she's really gone.

437
00:21:41,888 --> 00:21:44,055
I can't believe I'll
never get to hold her again

438
00:21:44,123 --> 00:21:45,624
or...

439
00:21:50,696 --> 00:21:53,565
I miss my little girl so much.

440
00:21:59,739 --> 00:22:03,775
Your daughter sounds like
she was really special.

441
00:22:03,843 --> 00:22:05,911
I lost my sister
a few weeks ago.

442
00:22:05,978 --> 00:22:09,014
Oh. I'm so sorry.

443
00:22:09,081 --> 00:22:11,450
Look. Uh, how about
I buy you a cup of coffee

444
00:22:11,517 --> 00:22:13,952
and we can talk about it?

445
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,887
I got to say this guy's
pain felt so real.

446
00:22:15,955 --> 00:22:18,256
It's hard to believe
he was faking it.

447
00:22:18,324 --> 00:22:19,658
My guess is he
probably gets some kind

448
00:22:19,725 --> 00:22:21,193
of perverse pleasure from it,

449
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,795
grew up unable to access
any kind of real emotion,

450
00:22:23,863 --> 00:22:24,963
so he started mimicking it,

451
00:22:25,031 --> 00:22:26,231
found out he had a true talent.

452
00:22:26,232 --> 00:22:27,666
Now he's Laurence Olivier.

453
00:22:27,733 --> 00:22:29,334
Ryan, security called.

454
00:22:29,402 --> 00:22:31,103
Gwen's downstairs.

455
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:32,871
Ok. Be right back.

456
00:22:32,939 --> 00:22:34,439
Yeah.

457
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,211
Hey.

458
00:22:39,278 --> 00:22:41,179
Figured you could use
a decent cup of coffee.

459
00:22:41,247 --> 00:22:42,214
Wow.

460
00:22:42,281 --> 00:22:43,582
I got cake pops, too.

461
00:22:43,649 --> 00:22:46,384
Oh, wow. Thanks.
You're really sweet.

462
00:22:46,452 --> 00:22:48,787
This is really not
a good day for this.

463
00:22:48,855 --> 00:22:50,355
Sure. I understand.

464
00:22:50,423 --> 00:22:51,456
Are you--you ok?

465
00:22:51,524 --> 00:22:53,058
Yeah, just busy.

466
00:22:55,628 --> 00:22:57,529
Honestly, it looks
like it's gonna be

467
00:22:57,597 --> 00:22:58,797
very busy for a while,

468
00:22:58,865 --> 00:23:00,599
so there's a pretty good chance

469
00:23:00,666 --> 00:23:02,367
that you're not gonna see
that much of me if at all.

470
00:23:02,435 --> 00:23:04,136
What are you doing?

471
00:23:04,203 --> 00:23:05,837
What? What do
you mean?

472
00:23:05,905 --> 00:23:07,606
If feels like you're
pushing me away.

473
00:23:07,673 --> 00:23:09,374
No, I'm not.

474
00:23:11,043 --> 00:23:13,678
It's happening again, isn't it?

475
00:23:13,746 --> 00:23:15,280
Is it Joe?

476
00:23:16,616 --> 00:23:20,218
No. I--I--I, uh, I think
it's something else,

477
00:23:20,286 --> 00:23:21,987
but there is a real possibility

478
00:23:22,054 --> 00:23:23,688
that it's gonna take over
my life for a while,

479
00:23:23,756 --> 00:23:25,891
and I just--

480
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:27,592
I want to protect
you from this stuff.

481
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,928
We've got something
really special, Ryan.

482
00:23:29,996 --> 00:23:31,997
I know you feel it, too.

483
00:23:32,065 --> 00:23:34,966
Don't be so quick
to throw us away.

484
00:23:36,836 --> 00:23:39,337
Ryan, we got a hit
on our grieving father.

485
00:23:39,405 --> 00:23:40,806
Andrew Jacobs.

486
00:23:40,873 --> 00:23:42,007
His driver's license
was issued 10 months ago.

487
00:23:42,075 --> 00:23:43,275
Before that, he didn't exist.

488
00:23:43,342 --> 00:23:45,010
Address in Greenpoint.

489
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:48,680
It's ok. Go.

490
00:23:48,748 --> 00:23:50,015
I'll call you.

491
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:51,950
Thanks for the coffee.

492
00:24:02,228 --> 00:24:03,995
Warm and inviting it's not.

493
00:24:04,063 --> 00:24:05,797
Don't tell me
you got soft overseas.

494
00:24:05,865 --> 00:24:07,265
Not a chance.

495
00:26:02,282 --> 00:26:03,949
Wait, wait.

496
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:26,961
_

497
00:26:37,193 --> 00:26:39,327
First, you're the liar, now me.

498
00:26:39,395 --> 00:26:41,563
Why does this feel so familiar?

499
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,661
Because it is.

500
00:26:50,728 --> 00:26:52,429
You lived this moment,

501
00:26:52,497 --> 00:26:53,630
you both did.

502
00:26:53,698 --> 00:26:54,832
It's a tableau

503
00:26:54,899 --> 00:26:57,000
of Max shooting Luke.

504
00:27:01,906 --> 00:27:03,707
You're right.

505
00:27:03,775 --> 00:27:05,742
I was standing in the doorway.

506
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,481
Mike, you were
on the ground there.

507
00:27:13,785 --> 00:27:15,953
Luke was about to kill you,

508
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,321
and I fired.

509
00:27:24,329 --> 00:27:27,431

Well, there's plenty
more, so eat up.

535
00:28:33,598 --> 00:28:34,832
Ok, ok, everybody.
Listen up.

536
00:28:34,899 --> 00:28:36,467
Our boy Mark is punishing us

537
00:28:36,534 --> 00:28:37,814
for killing
his family last year.

538
00:28:37,869 --> 00:28:39,837
These murder scenes
are re-creations

539
00:28:39,904 --> 00:28:41,171
of their deaths.

540
00:28:41,239 --> 00:28:42,473
That's Max there with the gun

541
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,374
when she killed Luke,

542
00:28:44,442 --> 00:28:46,910
Agent Weston on his knees,

543
00:28:46,978 --> 00:28:48,345
and that's me

544
00:28:48,413 --> 00:28:50,047
right after I killed Giselle,

545
00:28:50,115 --> 00:28:52,015
Mark's adopted sister.

546
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:53,550
The scenes that Luke
and Mark staged last year

547
00:28:53,618 --> 00:28:55,119
were more rudimentary.

548
00:28:55,186 --> 00:28:56,820
They used whatever was at
hand to pose the bodies.

549
00:28:56,888 --> 00:28:58,489
This is much more sophisticated.

550
00:28:58,556 --> 00:29:01,558
Which means that Mark
has his own followers now.

551
00:29:07,031 --> 00:29:08,298
Mark.

552
00:29:11,403 --> 00:29:13,670
We're getting ready
to go do the next one.

553
00:29:13,738 --> 00:29:15,239
You said you wanted to come.

554
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:20,310
I can't.

555
00:29:20,378 --> 00:29:21,412
You sure?

556
00:29:21,479 --> 00:29:22,513
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

557
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,514
Go ahead without me.

558
00:29:23,581 --> 00:29:24,681
Ok.

559
00:29:24,749 --> 00:29:26,417
No problem.

560
00:29:41,332 --> 00:29:43,267
What do you mean can't?

561
00:29:43,334 --> 00:29:45,002
Hey. This is
our revenge!

562
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:47,204
You have to go!

563
00:29:47,272 --> 00:29:48,939
You don't understand.

564
00:29:49,007 --> 00:29:50,507
It's too painful.

565
00:29:50,575 --> 00:29:51,496
Painful? Try being shot

566
00:29:51,543 --> 00:29:53,944
in the friggin' head!

567
00:29:54,012 --> 00:29:55,979
I know. You're right. I'm sorry.

568
00:29:56,047 --> 00:29:57,727
Well, don't
be sorry, little bro.

569
00:29:57,782 --> 00:30:00,784
Be angry.

570
00:30:00,852 --> 00:30:02,352
Yeah.

571
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,921
They killed us,

572
00:30:03,988 --> 00:30:05,122
and they covered it up.

573
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,091
We've got to make them pay.

574
00:30:08,927 --> 00:30:10,994
We have alerts out on
Mark across the city.

575
00:30:11,062 --> 00:30:13,864
Why is he writing you've
lied at every scene?

576
00:30:13,932 --> 00:30:14,898
- Lied about what?
- I don't know.

577
00:30:14,966 --> 00:30:17,034
Ryan, I'm not buying--

578
00:30:17,102 --> 00:30:18,569
He's delusional, Gina.

579
00:30:18,636 --> 00:30:20,237
Him and his brother
were psychotically close.

580
00:30:20,305 --> 00:30:21,939
I can't imagine what
losing Luke has done

581
00:30:22,006 --> 00:30:24,875
to his fractured mind.

582
00:30:24,943 --> 00:30:28,245
But I do know who his next
target's gonna look like--

583
00:30:28,313 --> 00:30:29,880
Lily Gray.

584
00:30:32,751 --> 00:30:35,719
I don't get it. Why
would he sit this one out?

585
00:30:35,787 --> 00:30:38,355
I'd unleash hell
on earth if you got killed.

586
00:30:38,423 --> 00:30:41,158
I guess Mark's just a little
more sensitive than you.

587
00:30:43,361 --> 00:30:45,963
Why am I letting
you guys have all the fun?

588
00:30:47,999 --> 00:30:50,234
Come on. Let's go
kill some people.

589
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,543
Max, got anything?

590
00:31:08,663 --> 00:31:10,729
Pull it up.
CCTV camera

591
00:31:10,797 --> 00:31:11,730
at the Lincoln
Center subway stop

592
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:13,039
took this 20 minutes ago.

593
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:14,459
Ok. He's not dressed
like that for fun.

594
00:31:14,527 --> 00:31:15,861
Any catered events
in the neighborhood?

595
00:31:15,928 --> 00:31:18,030
I mean, it's New York.
There's probably 50.

596
00:31:18,097 --> 00:31:19,564
We got to think like Mark.

597
00:31:19,632 --> 00:31:21,566
He's looking for a
doppelganger for his mother.

598
00:31:21,634 --> 00:31:23,669
Where would he go to find her?

599
00:31:23,736 --> 00:31:25,304
Got it. Art fundraiser
5 blocks from there.

600
00:31:25,371 --> 00:31:27,506
That's it!
Have NYPD meet us there.

601
00:31:27,573 --> 00:31:30,042
Code two, urgent!

602
00:31:55,101 --> 00:31:58,203
Luke, what about her?

603
00:31:58,271 --> 00:32:02,174
Hmm. Mom was way prettier.

604
00:32:02,241 --> 00:32:03,976
Yeah. You're right.

605
00:32:08,081 --> 00:32:09,948
Hi!

606
00:32:10,016 --> 00:32:11,617
Oh, she's perfect.

607
00:32:18,691 --> 00:32:20,158
We're on.

608
00:32:31,871 --> 00:32:33,372
Excuse me.

609
00:32:33,439 --> 00:32:34,673
Oh! Oh!

610
00:32:34,741 --> 00:32:36,775
I'm so sorry.

611
00:32:36,843 --> 00:32:38,610
It's ok.

612
00:32:38,678 --> 00:32:40,812
Um, I-I just need
a bathroom.

613
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,247
There's a big line
for the one up here,

614
00:32:42,315 --> 00:32:44,082
but the one downstairs is empty.

615
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:45,384
Here. Let me
show you.

616
00:33:25,792 --> 00:33:27,159
You think Mark's gonna be here?

617
00:33:27,227 --> 00:33:28,927
It's his mother.
He won't leave

618
00:33:28,995 --> 00:33:30,762
this tableau to his followers.

619
00:33:34,367 --> 00:33:35,834
Ok. Fan out.

620
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,381
FBI! Don't panic!

621
00:33:49,449 --> 00:33:50,716
Aah!

622
00:34:27,587 --> 00:34:29,555
Ugh! Agh!

623
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,940
You ok?

624
00:34:48,007 --> 00:34:49,708
I'm good.
Where's Mark?!

625
00:34:49,776 --> 00:34:52,344
Sorry. You're too late.

626
00:35:06,526 --> 00:35:09,862
Let me out!

627
00:35:09,929 --> 00:35:12,264
Let me out, let me out!

628
00:35:13,633 --> 00:35:16,235
Let me out of here!

629
00:35:16,302 --> 00:35:19,571
Why you just sitting there?

630
00:35:19,639 --> 00:35:21,440
Come on.
Get out of the car.

631
00:35:21,508 --> 00:35:25,010
Come on!
Let me out!

632
00:35:25,078 --> 00:35:27,279
I don't think
I can do this, Luke.

633
00:35:27,347 --> 00:35:28,714
Well, you have to.

634
00:35:28,782 --> 00:35:31,583
You have to kill her
and finish what we started.

635
00:35:31,651 --> 00:35:33,152
Hey. Will you shut up!

636
00:35:35,255 --> 00:35:37,156
Nobody's talking to you.

637
00:35:46,733 --> 00:35:51,603
Will you come with me?

638
00:35:51,671 --> 00:35:54,540
Of course.

639
00:35:54,607 --> 00:35:56,675
I'm always with you.

640
00:35:59,379 --> 00:36:02,648
Yeah.

641
00:36:02,715 --> 00:36:04,083
Yeah. I know.

642
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,551
Please!

643
00:36:28,108 --> 00:36:29,908
Please!

644
00:36:29,976 --> 00:36:31,710
Don't do this.

645
00:36:34,414 --> 00:36:35,647
No!

646
00:36:35,715 --> 00:36:38,283
Mom! Mom, I'm sorry.

647
00:36:42,222 --> 00:36:44,156
No. Get up.

648
00:36:44,224 --> 00:36:45,924
No, no, no. No.

649
00:36:45,992 --> 00:36:48,894
Hey. Don't go.
Don't go. Don't go.

650
00:36:48,962 --> 00:36:51,296
Please don't go.
Don't leave me.

651
00:36:51,364 --> 00:36:55,000
Please don't leave me.
I've been so lonely without you.

652
00:36:55,068 --> 00:36:57,102
Mom, I'm sorry.

653
00:36:57,170 --> 00:36:59,821
Please don't leave me.
Come back.

654
00:37:13,556 --> 00:37:15,057
Knock it off.

655
00:37:16,993 --> 00:37:19,595
Eh, you're no fun.

656
00:37:19,662 --> 00:37:22,130
When's the last time
you had a good cry?

657
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:23,438
It can be incredibly cathartic.

658
00:37:23,466 --> 00:37:25,167
Yeah, but it's gonna make you

659
00:37:25,235 --> 00:37:27,182
all the wrong kinds
of friends in prison.

660
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,473
You know, you should
have seen your face

661
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,575
when I called you a murderer.

662
00:37:33,643 --> 00:37:34,743
I mean, you were shocked,

663
00:37:34,811 --> 00:37:37,679
but there was a part of you

664
00:37:37,747 --> 00:37:40,115
that welcomed it

665
00:37:40,183 --> 00:37:41,350
because you know it's true.

666
00:37:41,417 --> 00:37:42,517
Where's Mark Gray?

667
00:37:42,585 --> 00:37:46,355
Oh. Such
a sad story.

668
00:37:46,422 --> 00:37:48,257
His whole family was killed
by you and your friends.

669
00:37:48,324 --> 00:37:51,126
Yeah. What do you
care, huh?

670
00:37:51,194 --> 00:37:52,828
What's Mark to you?

671
00:38:09,145 --> 00:38:10,846
Thank you for coming.

672
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:12,614
I didn't know who else to call.

673
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:23,792
I'm a sucker
for a good revenge tale,

674
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,928
but this--
heh heh heh--

675
00:38:25,995 --> 00:38:29,097
this is gonna be so much more.

676
00:38:29,165 --> 00:38:31,600
You have no idea what's coming.

677
00:38:31,668 --> 00:38:35,170
Ok. So this moment
may be new to you,

678
00:38:35,238 --> 00:38:37,139
but I've sat in this chair,

679
00:38:37,206 --> 00:38:38,807
and I've had this
very conversation,

680
00:38:38,875 --> 00:38:41,043
and the guy I had it
with is on death row,

681
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,712
and I'm still here.

682
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:48,483
So you can spare me
the scary proclamations.

683
00:38:48,551 --> 00:38:50,752
Do you have the time?

684
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:54,089
Got someplace you got to be?

685
00:38:54,157 --> 00:38:57,326
No, but...

686
00:38:57,393 --> 00:38:58,894

Me, too.

I'm sorry.

723
00:42:12,088 --> 00:42:13,922
I shouldn't have
pressured you earlier.

724
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:16,325
No. You were right.

725
00:42:16,392 --> 00:42:18,226
I was pushing you away.

726
00:42:18,294 --> 00:42:20,295
It's my pattern,

727
00:42:20,363 --> 00:42:23,899
and, uh, I don't want
to do it anymore.

728
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,170
I need you.

729
00:42:30,106 --> 00:42:31,540
I need you, too.

730
00:42:52,929 --> 00:42:56,198
Today was hard.

731
00:42:56,265 --> 00:43:00,068
You really helped me
get through it.

732
00:43:00,136 --> 00:43:03,138
You did great.

733
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:04,873
I'm proud of you.

734
00:43:11,948 --> 00:43:14,716
Thanks.

735
00:43:14,784 --> 00:43:16,351
Tomorrow will be easier.

736
00:43:16,419 --> 00:43:17,919
Are you kidding me?

737
00:43:17,987 --> 00:43:19,654
Tomorrow will be awesome

738
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:23,658
because tomorrow
one of them dies.

739
00:43:27,163 --> 00:43:28,363
Hmm.

740
00:43:28,431 --> 00:43:30,198
Heh.
